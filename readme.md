Patch this mod near the bottom.

Adds a system to the game: the EMP Generator, which
creates an EMP at cursor location, destroying projectiles, stunning drones and crew, and forcefully opening doors within its radius. 
Base cooldown of 20s, base diameter of 96px, base cost of 100 scrap.
The EMP can also be dynamically configured to have an increased radius at the cost of increased system cooldown, and vice versa. 

This mod requires Hyperspace.
This mod requires ftlman to function normally unless if you manually specify the system 'empgenerator' in the blueprints of the ships you are using (ftlman appends the system automatically to all applicable blueprints).

The mod comes with 3 ships equipped with the system by default, balanced for vanilla.
Some ships cannot install the system at all (vanilla stealth C for instance).
You can make the system take the same slot as another one, such as mind control to circumvent this, but then you have can't have them both at once.
This mod directly supports Vanilla Hyperspace, INS+ and Multiverse. The system might not show up in shops with other mods.

Adding support for specific mods is often not very difficult to do, so report any issues you have with any mods.
Reporting any issue is best done by raising an issue on this github page. You can alternatively message me on discord, #daemon8363. I will not respond to posts on the FTL forum in a timely manner, so please don't post anything important there.
Feel free to use this system, any code, or any idea in any of your mods if you want.
